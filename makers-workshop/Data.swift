    Jasper was no ordinary Corgi. He had lived his entire life within the gilded walls of the Queen's palace. The plush carpets, the gourmet treats, the endless attention - it was a life most dogs could only dream of. Yet, beneath the surface of his pampered existence, Jasper felt a stirring within him, a yearning for something more.
